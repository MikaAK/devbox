I recently wiped my harddrive and did a reset. These are the scripts I used to get it back up.

In order you would run

- linux-instals or osx-installs depending on the OS
- fish-installs
- editor-installs
- dotfiles script
- git-aliases
- linux-installs after everything (if on linux)

## Installs
- fishshell
- git
- hub (only osx)
- postgresql
- brew (only osx)
- imagemagik
- elixir
- cmake
- Google Chrome
- asdf (elixir)
- n (node)

#### Git Commands
- `ncommit` - commit no verify no-edit
- `npush` - push no verify
- `lg` - pretty log
- `ignore-file` - ignore file from push
