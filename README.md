I recently wiped my harddrive and did a reset. These are the scripts I used to get it back up.

In order you would run
- xcode.sh
- brew-node.sh
- after-brew.sh
- install-postgres.sh
- edvisor-install.sh

## Installs
- fishshell
- git
- hub
- postgresql
- brew
- imagemagik
- elixir
- cmake
- Google Chrome

## Edvisor Installs
Installs MySql 5.6 and pulls our repo into ~/Documents/Edvisor/app
